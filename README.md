# `obs-studio-node` Docs
This is some documentation created by reverse engineering [Streamlabs OBS](github.com/stream-labs/streamlabs-obs/), heavily based on the tests done by @Envek, @EmptyCrown and others in [obs-studio-node-example](https://github.com/Envek/obs-studio-node-example).

If you can improve those docs, feel free to create a PR!

## Why?
I created a PR to the official `obs-studio-node` Repository in May 2020 but they keep ignoring it. That's why I moved the docs here.
